# Development handoff — 2026-09-29

## Intent and workflow

The user wants personal-use improvements, with no commercialisation work.
Inference stays local. The user explicitly requested natural-language
search with summaries as the default and transcripts as an optional next
search. Close each development step with checks, its own commit, and an
updated handoff so Claude can continue without reconstructing the chat.

Read `CLAUDE.md` for project constraints. Existing phase documents are
historical; this file describes the current work.

## Step 1 — local meeting search: complete in source

- Search box in the inbox; Enter and the primary button search summaries.
- Explicit **Search available transcripts** after summary results, even
  when there are no matches. No automatic transcript search or transcription.
- Local Ollama produces schema-constrained groups of required concepts
  and synonyms. Only the query goes to the model, not recording content.
- Visible exact-keyword fallback on interpretation failure; loopback/local
  inference guard; whole-term matching to avoid DR matching “address”.
- Includes hidden library rows and known Markdown exports. Missing source
  content is counted; results contain excerpts and source labels.
- Retain results by source for the current question. Editing/clearing it
  resets results; explicit summary submission refreshes them.
- Retrieval is phrase matching after language interpretation, not an
  embedding index, date-filter parser, or generated answer across meetings.

Main files: `main/meetingSearch.ts`, `main/meetingContent.ts`,
`renderer/inbox/MeetingSearch.tsx`, `shared/search.ts`, plus IPC/preload
wiring and `State.listSearchableJoined()`. Paths are under `packages/app/src`.

Verification: a clean export of the staged checkpoint passed the normal
`npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (105 tests), and `npm run build`, without
excluding files. A browser fixture checked summary → transcript → summary.
Live smoke test used the configured `qwen3.8:27b-mlx` model with synthetic
records: “A call with HSBC that talked about DR” produced
`[["hsbc"],["dr","disaster recovery"]]` and matched only the intended
recording without fallback. No real meeting content was used.

## Workspace caveat

This iCloud working directory already contained untracked numbered copies
such as `src/main/ipc 2.ts`, `src/main/config 2.ts`,
`src/preload/index 2.ts`, and `test/poller.test 2.ts`, as well as
`Whisper Hints /`. Leave these untouched and out of feature commits.
The copies reference missing old modules and break broad TypeScript/test
globs in this working directory. Validate a clean checkpoint copy, or
exclude these known duplicates when checking the active source. Do not
change the production typecheck configuration just to hide them.

Normal checks in a clean checkout, from `packages/app`:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Ollama transport tests bind a localhost mock server; a sandbox without
socket access causes unrelated timeouts. Run those checks with localhost
access. Native `better-sqlite3` remains built for Electron; existing tests
avoid opening a real DB from Node.

## Next step

Build a separate resizable meeting reader, opened from search results and
completed recordings, with summary/transcript views, local find, safe
Markdown rendering, and clear missing-content states. Reuse local text and
known Markdown exports. Source-linked audio needs preserved timestamps
and a VAD-to-original-audio time map, so it is a later step.

Subsequent ideas, not implemented or fully specified: client preparation
briefs; a confirmed action/decision register; correction-to-vocabulary
suggestions; versioned re-summarisation; long-meeting chunking/coverage;
idle/overnight processing; diagnostics and backup/restore.

No package has been installed or release published as part of this work.
